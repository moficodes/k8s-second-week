# Whats Next

Kubernetes has many moving parts and this is just the second week.

There are many more things we need to learn.

Where to go next. 

* [Kubernetes Docs ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)For understanding basic operations
* [Kubernetes Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) For little hands on training
* [Kubernetes Reference ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/)For understanding the tools and api
* And 100,000 other blog posts. 🤷🏻‍♂️

If you want to try to make your own kubernetes cluster you can check a blog post I wrote.
