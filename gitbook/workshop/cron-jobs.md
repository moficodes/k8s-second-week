# Cron Jobs

For anyone coming from the linux world cron job is a known term. But I won't assume that you are. 

Cron jobs are jobs that run at specific interval. Say you want to run some batch job everyday at 12. Or say you want clean up or process some data in the database every hour, cron jobs are your friend.
