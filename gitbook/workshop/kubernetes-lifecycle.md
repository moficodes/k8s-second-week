# Kubernetes Lifecycle

This one is a hidden gem. You probably read or heard in the cloud native world we are supposed to gracefully shutdown. What does it mean really? I mean if something bad happened and we had to exit the container what can we really do? Thats where lifecycle hooks are pretty useful.
