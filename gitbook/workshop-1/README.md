# Workshop

This workshop has 4 ish parts. 

First we will looking at some theory and learn how scheduler works in kubernetes.

Next we will learn about some lesser known/used primitives in kubernetes.

Then we will learn about some patterns that are used commonly in kubernetes.

Finally if time permits we will learn some secrets and security measures we can take. This won't be a complete setup. Security in kubernetes can and should be a separate workshop. And we will do that soon.
