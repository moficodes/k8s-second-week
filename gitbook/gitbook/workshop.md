# Kubernetes the Second Week

## Motivation

As someone who learns and teaches Kubernetes on a daily basis, having access to material that is not only good for intro stuff but also works great for teaching intermediate concepts is crucial. This is something I wanted to find for learning. So when I didn't find it, I thought I would make it myself.

## What does second week mean?

In this hypothetical world, I am considering mastering Kubernetes as a 4 week task. In the first week you have done your typical 101 stuff. You know what most of the primitives are \(pod, deployment, service\). You have deployed your first example application \(or maybe your application that you containerized\). Kubernetes is still for the most part a mystery.
